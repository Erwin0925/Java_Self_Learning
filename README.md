Write a Java program to remove the nth element from the end of a given list.

## Questions - Constructor

### 14. Default Constructor in a Class
Write a Java program to create a class called `Cat` with instance variables `name` and `age`. Implement a default constructor that initializes `name` to `"Unknown"` and `age` to `0`. Print the values of these variables.

### 15. Parameterized Constructor
Write a Java program to create a class called `Dog` with instance variables `name` and `color`. Implement a parameterized constructor that takes `name` and `color` as parameters.

### 16. Constructor Overloading
Write a Java program to create a class called `Book` with instance variables `title`, `author`, and `price`. Implement a default constructor and two parameterized constructors:
    - One constructor takes `title` and `author` as parameters.
    - The other constructor takes `title`, `author`, and `price` as parameters.

### 17. Constructor Chaining
Write a Java program to create a class called `Student` with instance variables `studentId`, `studentName`, and `grade`. Implement a default constructor and a parameterized constructor that takes all three instance variables. Use constructor chaining to initialize the variables.
